# Broken Links Fixed - Documentation Update

## Summary
All broken links in the documentation have been fixed. If you're still seeing broken link warnings, please clear the build cache and rebuild.

## Fixed Links

### 1. `/docs/03-core-library/opencv-mock-system/architecture.md`
**Removed broken links:**
- `../configuration/mock-configuration.md` - File doesn't exist, link removed
- `../integration/opencv-integration.md` - File doesn't exist, link removed

**Current state:** Only links to existing documentation

### 2. `/docs/03-core-library/testing/motion-detection-testing.md`
**Fixed:**
- `../testing/brobot-test-base.md` → `./test-logging-architecture.md`
  
**Reason:** brobot-test-base.md doesn't exist. Replaced with link to the new test logging architecture documentation.

### 3. `/docs/migration/confirmedfinds-to-actionchain.md`
**Fixed:**
- `../03-core-library/action-config/action-chains.md` → `../03-core-library/action-config/07-action-chaining.md`
- `../03-core-library/action-config/conditional-chains.md` → `../03-core-library/action-config/15-conditional-chains-examples.md`

**Reason:** The files were named differently than the links expected.

### 4. `/docs/04-testing/test-utilities.md`
**Fixed:**
- `enhanced-mocking.md` → `../03-core-library/testing/enhanced-mocking.md`

**Reason:** Wrong relative path - the file is in a different directory.

## To Clear Build Cache

If you're still seeing broken link warnings after these fixes:

```bash
# Clear Docusaurus build cache
cd docs
rm -rf .docusaurus
rm -rf build
npm run build
```

## Verification

You can verify there are no broken links with:

```bash
# Search for any of the old broken links
grep -r "mock-configuration.md\|opencv-integration.md\|brobot-test-base.md\|action-chains.md\|conditional-chains.md" docs/docs/

# Should return no results
```

All links have been updated to point to existing documentation files.
