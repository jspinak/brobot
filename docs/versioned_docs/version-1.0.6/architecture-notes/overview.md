# Overview

This section is primarily for me and for any other developer
who wishes to contribute to the project. It describes architecture
decisions, details the proposed architecture, explains why the decision 
was made, and shows how the chosen architecture aligns with project goals.
Architecture decisions are too broad to include in the codebase, and 
having a record of them here allows me to review past decisions in 
the context in which they were taken. Changes to the project goals
or problems caused by the current architecture often require 
rethinking the architecture, and having a record of past decisions helps 
in this process.
