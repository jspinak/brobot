# Live Automation

The automation pauses briefly to capture an image of the current island.
After each pause, you can see the filename printed in the console and the
file appear in the folder on the right. The filename
will be the island type (you can verify on screen that it is correct) + the number
of islands found of this type. This is just the beginning of the automation, which
runs until it has captured images for 100 islands.
