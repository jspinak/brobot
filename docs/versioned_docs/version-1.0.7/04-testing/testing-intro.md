# Overview

Brobot has 3 types of testing: integration testing, unit testing, and
action recording. Their primary strengths are the following:

- Integration testing: making the application more robust in an inherently stochastic
  environment (reducing the variability of results).
- Unit testing: making sure that parts of the application work as expected (increasing
  the accuracy of results).
- Action recording: similar to unit testing, focused on the accuracy of results, but
  performed visually.
