# Live Automation

The automation pauses briefly to capture an image of the current island.
After each pause, you can see the filename printed in the console. The filename
will be the island type (you can verify on screen that it is correct) + the number
of islands found of this type. Since this was the second live run, the number for
'farms' begins at 38. The automation runs until it has captured images for 100 islands.
