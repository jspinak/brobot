# Overview

In the documentation, objects are referred to with a capital letter: for example, 
an Image object. This is done to emphasize that the object itself is being referenced, 
not just an image in the general sense of the word. 

Most, but not all, data objects have getters and setters associated with them. 
Getter and setter methods are not included in the documentation.
