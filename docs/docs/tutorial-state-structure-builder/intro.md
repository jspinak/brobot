# Intro

This tutorial should take about **20 minutes**.  

We're going to build the State Structure for a new application using the
State Structure builder. We will perform the following steps:
1. Instruct Brobot to save screenshots while we perform tasks manually  
2. Select screenshots to keep
3. Capture and label images from the screenshots
4. Analyze the quality of our selected images and regions with Brobot
5. Use the State Structure builder to automate the creation of folders and classes

# Requirements

Any software that can cut and save images.  
  
Some suggestions:      
Mac: Preview   
Windows: Photos, Paint   
Linux: XPaint, Pinta   

# Some other stuff

This demo is meant as a guide to Brobot's State Structure build tool, as well 
as an introduction to its image analysis capabilities and how to use them to 
create a more robust application. The tutorial is done using the game 
Black Desert Online as the environment because it is a pretty, complex, and fun
environment that provides clear use cases for Brobot's functionality. A Brobot 
application on Black Desert can be used for research on machine vision but 
not with reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning requires that the 
application react to and control the environment, which is not possible with Brobot
in a game that has an anti-cheat. Brobot is an automation framework 
and not a cheat engine, and has no capabilities to bypass anti-cheat software.
