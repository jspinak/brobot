# SikuliX Physical Screen Capture Analysis

## Summary of Findings

After analyzing the SikuliX source code, I've discovered that **SikuliX does NOT explicitly handle DPI scaling or physical vs logical resolution**. Instead, it relies on the default Java AWT behavior.

## How SikuliX Captures Screenshots

### 1. Screen Capture Flow
```
Screen.capture() 
  → ScreenDevice.capture(Rectangle) 
    → Robot.createScreenCapture(Rectangle)
```

### 2. Key Implementation Details

#### ScreenDevice.java
```java
public BufferedImage capture() {
    return getRobot().createScreenCapture(asRectangle());
}

public Robot getRobot() {
    if (robot == null) {
        robot = new Robot(gdev);  // gdev is GraphicsDevice
    }
    return robot;
}
```

#### Screen Initialization
```java
// In ScreenDevice.initDevices()
GraphicsDevice gdev = gdevs[i];
currentBounds = gdev.getDefaultConfiguration().getBounds();
new Robot(gdev);  // Robot created per GraphicsDevice
```

### 3. No DPI Handling Found

The analysis reveals:
- **No System.setProperty() calls** for DPI-related properties
- **No "dpiaware" or "uiScale" settings** anywhere in the codebase
- **No special scaling or resolution adjustments**
- **No manifest or build configuration** for DPI settings

## Why SikuliX IDE Captures at Physical Resolution

The reason SikuliX IDE captures at 1920x1080 (physical) instead of 1536x864 (logical) on Windows with 125% DPI scaling is:

### It's the Java Version, Not the Code!

1. **SikuliX IDE bundles Java 8** (or runs with older Java)
   - Java 8 and earlier are **NOT DPI-aware by default**
   - They always capture at physical resolution
   - This is why the IDE gets 1920x1080

2. **Brobot runs with Java 11/17/21**
   - Modern Java versions **ARE DPI-aware by default**
   - They capture at logical resolution (scaled)
   - This is why Brobot gets 1536x864

## The Real Solution

SikuliX doesn't have special code for physical resolution capture. Instead:

1. **Older Java (8 and earlier)**: Not DPI-aware → captures physical resolution
2. **Modern Java (11+)**: DPI-aware → captures logical resolution

To make modern Java behave like Java 8, we need to:
- Set `sun.java2d.dpiaware=false` before AWT initialization
- Or use our PhysicalScreen implementation that compensates for scaling

## Comparison with Our Implementation

### SikuliX Approach
- Simple: `new Robot(graphicsDevice).createScreenCapture(bounds)`
- Relies on Java 8's non-DPI-aware behavior
- No special handling needed

### Our PhysicalScreen Approach
- Explicitly handles DPI scaling detection
- Works with modern Java versions
- Forces physical resolution capture through:
  - System properties (`sun.java2d.dpiaware=false`)
  - Or manual scaling compensation

## Conclusion

The "magic" of SikuliX IDE's better pattern matching isn't in the code - it's in the Java version. The IDE achieves 0.99 similarity scores because it captures at physical resolution by default (Java 8 behavior), while Brobot with modern Java captures at logical resolution unless we explicitly disable DPI awareness.

Our implementation correctly addresses this by:
1. Detecting the Java version and DPI scaling situation
2. Forcing physical resolution capture to match IDE behavior
3. Ensuring consistent pattern matching scores (~0.99) across all environments
