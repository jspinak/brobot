- **State Management**: Core state model and management classes
- **Action System**: Main action classes and result handling
- **Pattern Matching**: Image and element finding capabilities
- **Fluent API**: `Brobot`, `ActionSequenceBuilder`

### Sample of 377 Untested Classes
```
- ExecutionController.java
- ThreadSafeExecutionController.java
- ExecutionState.java
- ExecutionPauseController.java
- ConfigurationException.java
- ActionSequenceBuilder.java
- FluentApiExample.java
- Brobot.java
- AdjacentStates.java
- ... (368 more)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Only 2 Tests Are Running

1. **Test Hanging Issues**: 
   - Gradle test execution hangs after running first test class
   - Spring context initialization deadlocks
   - Blocking operations in @PostConstruct methods

2. **Configuration Problems**:
   - Missing or renamed classes causing compilation issues
   - Mock framework not properly initialized
   - Headless environment conflicts

3. **Scale Issues**:
   - 6000+ tests overwhelming the test runner
   - Memory/resource constraints
   - Gradle daemon issues

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Test Execution**:
   ```bash
   # Kill all Gradle daemons
   ./gradlew --stop
   
   # Use Python test runner with parallel execution
   python3 library/scripts/run-all-tests.py library --workers 8
   
   # Run specific test patterns to isolate issues
   python3 library/scripts/run-all-tests.py library --pattern "Test" --timeout 120
   ```

2. **Debug Hanging Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Run with debug output to identify hanging point
   ./gradlew :library:test --debug --no-daemon 2>&1 | tee test-debug.log
   
   # Check for specific problematic test classes
   ./gradlew :library:test --tests "*ExecutionControllerTest" --no-daemon
   ```

3. **Incremental Coverage Improvement**:
   - Start with "quick win" packages (< 500 instructions)
   - Focus on critical core packages (action, model, startup)
   - Use mock mode for all new tests

### Long-term Strategy

1. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Implement test categorization (@UnitTest, @IntegrationTest, @E2ETest)
   - Create separate test suites for different test types
   - Configure parallel execution properly

2. **Coverage Goals**:
   - **Phase 1**: Achieve 20% coverage by testing core packages
   - **Phase 2**: Reach 40% coverage with quick wins
   - **Phase 3**: Target 60% overall coverage
   - **Phase 4**: Maintain 80% coverage for new code

3. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Set up automated coverage reporting in CI/CD
   - Fail builds if coverage drops below threshold
   - Track coverage trends over time

## Test Execution Commands

### To Run Full Test Suite (When Fixed)
```bash
# Enhanced Python runner (RECOMMENDED)
python3 library/scripts/run-all-tests.py library --workers 8 --retry-failed

# Generate coverage after successful test run
./gradlew jacocoTestReport
python3 library/scripts/generate-test-coverage-report.py
```

### To Debug Current Issues
```bash
# Find which tests are actually compiled
find library/build/classes/java/test -name "*.class" | wc -l

# Check test discovery
./gradlew :library:test --dry-run

# Run with specific test class
./gradlew :library:test --tests "ScenePatternMatcherVerboseLoggingTest" --info
```

## Conclusion

The Brobot test suite is in a critical state with only 0.2% code coverage due to test execution failures. Only 2 out of 6000+ tests are running, leaving 99.4% of the codebase untested. Immediate action is required to:

1. Fix the test execution hanging issues
2. Use the Python test runner to bypass Gradle problems
3. Systematically increase coverage starting with critical core packages

The project has comprehensive test infrastructure in place, but it cannot be utilized until the execution issues are resolved.
