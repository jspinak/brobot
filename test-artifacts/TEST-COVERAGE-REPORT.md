### Test Execution Commands
To run tests successfully, use the `--no-daemon` flag:
```bash
# Stop any existing daemons
./gradlew --stop

# Run specific test classes
./gradlew :library:test --tests "TestClassName" --no-daemon

# Run tests matching pattern
./gradlew :library:test --tests "*Exception*Test" --no-daemon
```

## Key Findings

### Positive
1. ✅ All executable tests are passing (100% success rate)
2. ✅ ImageLoadingDiagnosticsRunner tests fixed and working
3. ✅ Exception handling tests comprehensive and passing
4. ✅ Test execution works with `--no-daemon` flag

### Areas for Improvement
1. ⚠️ Very low code coverage (< 1%) - most code is not tested
2. ⚠️ Many packages have 0% coverage
3. ⚠️ Full test suite hangs when running all tests together
4. ⚠️ Need to move Spring integration tests to library-test module

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Continue using `--no-daemon` flag for reliable test execution
2. Run tests in small batches rather than all at once
3. Focus on writing tests for uncovered critical packages

### Long-term Improvements
1. Increase test coverage for core packages:
   - io.github.jspinak.brobot.action (0% coverage)
   - io.github.jspinak.brobot.model.element (0% coverage)
   - io.github.jspinak.brobot.action.result (0% coverage)

2. Investigate and fix the root cause of test suite hanging when running all tests

3. Move remaining Spring integration tests to library-test module

4. Set up coverage goals (e.g., minimum 60% for critical packages)

## Test Reports Location
- HTML Test Report: `/library/build/reports/tests/test/index.html`
- JaCoCo Coverage Report: `/library/build/jacocoHtml/index.html`
- Test Execution Solution: `/TEST-EXECUTION-SOLUTION.md`

## Conclusion
While test execution issues have been resolved for individual test classes and small batches, there's significant room for improvement in overall test coverage. The current < 1% coverage indicates that the vast majority of the codebase is untested, presenting a significant technical debt that should be addressed systematically.
