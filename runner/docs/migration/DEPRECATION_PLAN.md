# Deprecation Plan for Legacy UI Components

## Overview

This document outlines the deprecation plan for legacy UI components that have been replaced by the refactored architecture using LabelManager and UIUpdateManager.

## Components to Deprecate

### Phase 1: Immediate Deprecation (Safe to Remove)

These components have direct replacements and no known dependencies:

1. **AutomationPanel** → Replaced by `UnifiedAutomationPanel`
   - Location: `/ui/AutomationPanel.java`
   - Singleton pattern removed
   - All functionality migrated

2. **EnhancedAutomationPanel** → Replaced by `UnifiedAutomationPanel`
   - Location: `/ui/EnhancedAutomationPanel.java`
   - Merged with AutomationPanel functionality
   - No unique features lost

3. **RefactoredBasicAutomationPanel** → Replaced by `UnifiedAutomationPanel`
   - Location: `/ui/RefactoredBasicAutomationPanel.java`
   - Intermediate refactoring attempt
   - Superseded by complete solution

4. **RefactoredEnhancedAutomationPanel** → Replaced by `UnifiedAutomationPanel`
   - Location: `/ui/RefactoredEnhancedAutomationPanel.java`
   - Intermediate refactoring attempt
   - Superseded by complete solution

### Phase 2: Careful Deprecation (Check Dependencies)

These components need dependency analysis before removal:

1. **ResourceMonitorPanel** → Replaced by `RefactoredResourceMonitorPanel`
   - Location: `/ui/ResourceMonitorPanel.java`
   - Check: MainUI references
   - Check: Event handler references

2. **ConfigDetailsPanel** → Replaced by `RefactoredConfigDetailsPanel`
   - Location: `/ui/config/ConfigDetailsPanel.java`
   - Check: Config UI framework references
   - Check: Factory pattern usage

3. **ExecutionDashboardPanel** → Replaced by `RefactoredExecutionDashboardPanel`
   - Location: `/ui/execution/ExecutionDashboardPanel.java`
   - Check: Execution framework references
   - Check: Event bus subscriptions

### Phase 3: Framework Updates

Components that require framework-level changes:

1. **UIEventHandler** → Using `RefactoredUIEventHandler`
   - Update all event routing
   - Remove singleton dependencies

2. **UiComponentFactory**
   - Update to create refactored components
   - Remove old component instantiation

## Deprecation Steps

### Step 1: Mark as Deprecated (Immediate)

Add deprecation annotations to all legacy components:

```java
/**
 * @deprecated Use {@link UnifiedAutomationPanel} instead.
 * This class will be removed in the next major version.
 */
@Deprecated(since = "2.0", forRemoval = true)
public class AutomationPanel {
    // ...
}
```

### Step 2: Update References (1-2 weeks)

1. Search for all usages:
   ```bash
   grep -r "AutomationPanel" src/ --include="*.java"
   grep -r "EnhancedAutomationPanel" src/ --include="*.java"
   grep -r "ResourceMonitorPanel" src/ --include="*.java"
   ```

2. Update each reference to use new components:
   ```java
   // Old
   AutomationPanel panel = AutomationPanel.getInstance().orElse(null);
   
   // New
   @Autowired
   UnifiedAutomationPanel panel;
   ```

3. Update Spring configuration if needed

### Step 3: Migration Testing (1 week)

1. Run full test suite
2. Perform manual testing of affected features
3. Run visual regression tests
4. Check memory usage and performance

### Step 4: Remove Deprecated Code (Next Release)

1. Delete deprecated source files
2. Remove from build configuration
3. Update documentation
4. Clean up test files

## Migration Checklist

### For Each Component:

- [ ] Add @Deprecated annotation
- [ ] Update JavaDoc with migration instructions
- [ ] Find all usages in codebase
- [ ] Update direct references
- [ ] Update factory/builder patterns
- [ ] Update Spring configurations
- [ ] Update event handlers
- [ ] Run unit tests
- [ ] Run integration tests
- [ ] Perform manual testing
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Remove source file
- [ ] Remove test files
- [ ] Clean up resources

## Risk Mitigation

### 1. Gradual Migration
- Keep deprecated components for one release cycle
- Provide clear migration path
- Support both old and new during transition

### 2. Compatibility Layer
```java
// Temporary adapter for backward compatibility
@Component
public class AutomationPanelAdapter {
    @Autowired
    private UnifiedAutomationPanel newPanel;
    
    // Delegate old API calls to new implementation
    public void oldMethod() {
        newPanel.newMethod();
    }
}
```

### 3. Feature Flags
```java
@Value("${ui.use-refactored-components:true}")
private boolean useRefactoredComponents;

public Component createPanel() {
    if (useRefactoredComponents) {
        return new RefactoredResourceMonitorPanel(...);
    } else {
        return new ResourceMonitorPanel(...);
    }
}
```

## Communication Plan

### 1. Development Team
- Team meeting to discuss deprecation
- Code review for migration changes
- Pair programming for complex migrations

### 2. Documentation Updates
- Update user guides
- Update API documentation
- Create migration guides
- Update README files

### 3. Release Notes
```markdown
## Breaking Changes
- AutomationPanel and EnhancedAutomationPanel have been replaced by UnifiedAutomationPanel
- ResourceMonitorPanel has been replaced by RefactoredResourceMonitorPanel
- See MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for details
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   - Revert to previous release
   - Re-enable deprecated components
   - Investigate issues

2. **Partial Rollback**
   - Keep some refactored components
   - Revert problematic ones
   - Use feature flags

3. **Fix Forward**
   - Address specific issues
   - Maintain new architecture
   - Patch as needed

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All tests pass with refactored components
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Visual regression tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing confirms functionality
- [ ] No user-reported issues after release

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Add deprecation annotations and notices
- **Week 2-3**: Update all references and dependencies
- **Week 4**: Testing and validation
- **Week 5**: Documentation and communication
- **Next Release**: Remove deprecated code

## Notes

- Keep backup of removed code in version control
- Document any discovered edge cases
- Update this plan as issues are found
- Consider keeping some adapters for external integrations
