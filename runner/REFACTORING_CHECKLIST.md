## Design Phase 🎨

### Architectural Design
- [ ] **Apply SOLID Principles**
  - [ ] Single Responsibility: Each class has one reason to change
  - [ ] Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
  - [ ] Liskov Substitution: Subtypes substitutable for base types
  - [ ] Interface Segregation: Many specific interfaces
  - [ ] Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions

- [ ] **Design New Structure**
  - [ ] Create package structure diagram
  - [ ] Define interfaces for each component
  - [ ] Plan data flow between components
  - [ ] Identify reusable patterns

- [ ] **Plan Migration Strategy**
  - [ ] Define feature flags needed
  - [ ] Plan incremental steps
  - [ ] Identify rollback points
  - [ ] Set success criteria

### Component Breakdown
- [ ] **Core Service**
  - [ ] Business logic only
  - [ ] No UI dependencies
  - [ ] No direct I/O
  - [ ] Clear API boundaries

- [ ] **Repository Layer**
  - [ ] Define repository interface
  - [ ] Plan storage strategy
  - [ ] Design entity models
  - [ ] Plan caching approach

- [ ] **State Management**
  - [ ] Identify stateful components
  - [ ] Design state transitions
  - [ ] Plan state persistence
  - [ ] Define invariants

- [ ] **Event System**
  - [ ] Identify events to publish
  - [ ] Define event contracts
  - [ ] Plan event flow
  - [ ] Design error handling

## Implementation Phase 🔨

### Core Implementation
- [ ] **Create New Package Structure**
  ```
  component/
  ├── core/          # Business logic
  ├── repository/    # Data access
  ├── state/         # State management
  ├── events/        # Event handling
  ├── diagnostics/   # Diagnostic support
  └── controller/    # Orchestration
  ```

- [ ] **Implement Interfaces First**
  - [ ] Service interfaces
  - [ ] Repository interfaces
  - [ ] Event interfaces
  - [ ] Diagnostic interfaces

- [ ] **Add AI-Friendly Features**

  - [ ] Add explicit error messages

- [ ] **Write Tests Alongside Code**
  - [ ] Unit tests for each class
  - [ ] Integration tests for workflows
  - [ ] Use test data builders
  - [ ] Add scenario-based tests

### Specific Requirements

#### For Each Class
- [ ] **Class Header**
  ```java
  /**
   * [Description of responsibility]
   * 
   * Behavioral Contract:
   * - [Invariant 1]
   * - [Invariant 2]
   * 
   * @since [version]
   */
  ```

- [ ] **Diagnostic Implementation**
  ```java
  @Override
  public DiagnosticInfo getDiagnosticInfo() {
      return DiagnosticInfo.builder()
          .component("[ClassName]")
          .state("key", value)
          .build();
  }
  ```

- [ ] **Logging Pattern**
  ```java
  String correlationId = MDC.get("correlationId");
  log.info("[{}] Operation starting", correlationId);
  ```

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  ```java
  throw new SpecificException(
      String.format("Operation failed: %s. Expected: %s, Actual: %s",
          reason, expected, actual),
      cause
  );
  ```

#### For Services
- [ ] Constructor injection only
- [ ] CompletableFuture for async operations
- [ ] Validate inputs explicitly
- [ ] Publish events for state changes
- [ ] No UI dependencies

#### For Repositories
