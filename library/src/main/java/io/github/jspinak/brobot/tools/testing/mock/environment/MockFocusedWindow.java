/**
 * Provides mock window focus functionality for testing scenarios.
 *
 * <p>This class simulates window focus detection in mock environments where actual GUI windows are
 * not present. It enables tests to run without requiring a real windowing system, making automated
 * testing more reliable and portable across different environments.
 *
 * <p>Key features:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Returns a default Region representing the focused window
 *   <li>Enables window-based operations in headless environments
 *   <li>Provides consistent behavior for reproducible tests
 *   <li>Eliminates dependencies on actual window manager state
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Use cases:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Testing window-relative operations without a GUI
 *   <li>Running tests in CI/CD pipelines without display
 *   <li>Simulating multi-window scenarios
 *   <li>Testing focus-dependent behaviors
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Current limitations:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Always returns a default Region (full screen)
 *   <li>Does not simulate actual window boundaries
 *   <li>No support for multiple windows or window switching
 *   <li>No window state tracking (minimized, maximized, etc.)
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Future enhancements could include:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Configurable window regions for different test scenarios
 *   <li>Multiple window simulation
 *   <li>Window state management (focus history, z-order)
 *   <li>Integration with mock state management
 * </ul>

     * <p>In the current implementation, this method always returns a new Region with default
     * dimensions (typically full screen). This provides a consistent target area for mock
     * operations that require a window context.
     *
     * <p>The returned Region can be used for:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Constraining search areas to the "focused window"
     *   <li>Calculating relative positions within a window
     *   <li>Simulating window-specific actions
     * </ul>
     *
     * @return A new Region instance representing the mock focused window. The Region uses default
     *     constructor values, typically representing the full screen area.
