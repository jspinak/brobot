/**
 * Builds a StateStructure using labeled images and screenshots of the automation environment.
 * The image filenames give instructions on how to organize States and what to do with the images;
 * for example, a name including '_d34' will define the Image's search area with the match found on
 * the screenshot with filename 'screen34.png'. A complete list of possible instructions is found
 * in the Brobot documentation website in GitHub.
 *
 * Output includes:
 * - Console output showing positive search results for images per screenshot,
 *   violations of filename instructions on a specific screenshot,
 *   the result of operations given by filename instructions
 * - A directory called 'stateStructure' on the project filepath with sub-folders for each
 *   class that include Java files for both the State and the StateTransitions.
 * - State classes are fully written and include enums, imports, all State object definitions,
 *   the State variable definition, and the constructor which adds the state to the StateService.
 * - StateImageObjects are defined with MatchSnapshots from matches found in the screenshots. In
 *   addition, they may be initialized with SearchRegions defined from a match or from the matches
 *   of a group of images in the same State.
 * - StateTransitions classes are also fully written and include all enums, imports, dependency
 *   injection, the finishTransition, and any other transition specified in the image filename.
 * - StateRegions defined by matching an image on a specific screenshot
 *
 * Building a StateStructure this way allows you to
 * - Create accurate MatchHistories with real matches
 * - Create StateRegions of otherwise difficult to capture regions (usually due to variable imagery)
 * - Work directly with the client's environment
 * - Get feedback on the accuracy and efficacy of your captured images before running the app live
 * - Save lots of time in typing out the State structure and avoid errors
