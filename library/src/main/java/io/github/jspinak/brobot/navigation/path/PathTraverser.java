/**
 * Executes navigation paths by performing state transitions in sequence.
 *
 * <p>PathTraverser is the execution component of the Path Traversal Model (ยง) in the Brobot
 * framework, responsible for converting abstract Path objects into concrete navigation actions. It
 * orchestrates the sequential execution of state transitions, monitors success and failure, and
 * tracks failure points for recovery operations.
 *
 * <p>Key responsibilities:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Path Execution</b>: Traverses states in order by invoking transitions
 *   <li><b>Failure Detection</b>: Identifies when and where transitions fail
 *   <li><b>Failure Tracking</b>: Records the starting state of failed transitions
 *   <li><b>Transition Completion</b>: Ensures final state transitions complete properly
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Traversal process:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Iterates through consecutive state pairs in the path
 *   <li>Executes the transition from current state to next state
 *   <li>Monitors transition success/failure
 *   <li>On failure, records the failure point and halts
 *   <li>On success, continues to next transition
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Failure handling:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>When a transition fails, the starting state is recorded
 *   <li>This information enables PathManager to clean invalid paths
 *   <li>Allows recovery by finding alternative paths from current position
 *   <li>Supports the framework's resilience to GUI variations
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Integration with model-based approach:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Transforms abstract paths into concrete actions
 *   <li>Provides feedback for path adaptation and learning
 *   <li>Enables dynamic recovery from navigation failures
 *   <li>Supports the stochastic nature of GUI environments
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In the model-based paradigm, PathTraverser bridges the gap between planning (pathfinding) and
 * execution (state transitions). It embodies the framework's ability to not just plan navigation
 * routes but actually execute them while adapting to real-world conditions.
