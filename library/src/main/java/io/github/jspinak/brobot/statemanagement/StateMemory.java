/**
 * Maintains the runtime memory of active States in the Brobot framework.
 *
 * <p>StateMemory is a critical component of the State Management System (Î¼), responsible for
 * tracking which states are currently active in the GUI. It serves as the framework's working
 * memory, maintaining an accurate understanding of the current GUI configuration throughout
 * automation execution.
 *
 * <p>Key responsibilities:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Active State Tracking</b>: Maintains a set of currently visible/active states
 *   <li><b>State Transitions</b>: Updates active states as the GUI changes
 *   <li><b>Match Integration</b>: Adjusts active states based on what is found during Find
 *       operations
 *   <li><b>State Probability</b>: Manages probability values for mock testing and uncertainty
 *       handling
 *   <li><b>Visit Tracking</b>: Records state visit counts for analysis and optimization
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Special state handling:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>PREVIOUS</b>: References states that are currently hidden but can be returned to
 *   <li><b>CURRENT</b>: The set of currently active states
 *   <li><b>EXPECTED</b>: States anticipated to become active after transitions
 *   <li><b>NULL State</b>: Ignored in active state tracking as it represents stateless elements
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In the model-based approach, StateMemory bridges the gap between the static state structure
 * and the dynamic runtime behavior of the GUI. It enables the framework to maintain context
 * awareness, recover from unexpected situations, and make intelligent decisions about navigation
 * and action execution.
