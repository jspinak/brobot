/**
 * Core interface for all actions in the Brobot model-based GUI automation framework.
 *
 * <p>ActionInterface defines the contract that all action implementations must follow, establishing
 * a uniform execution pattern across the entire Action Model (Î±). This interface is the foundation
 * of Brobot's action architecture, enabling polymorphic dispatch of diverse GUI operations through
 * a single, consistent API.
 *
 * <p>Key design principles:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Uniform Execution</b>: All actions, from simple clicks to complex workflows, implement
 *       the same perform() method signature
 *   <li><b>Result Accumulation</b>: Actions modify the provided Matches object to record their
 *       results and maintain execution context
 *   <li><b>Flexible Input</b>: Accepts variable ObjectCollections to support actions requiring
 *       different numbers of targets
 *   <li><b>Composability</b>: Enables actions to be combined into composite operations
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The perform method contract:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Receives a Matches object containing ActionOptions and accumulating results
 *   <li>Processes one or more ObjectCollections containing the action targets
 *   <li>Updates the Matches object with results of the action
 *   <li>May throw runtime exceptions for error conditions
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Implementation categories:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Basic Actions</b>: Click, Type, Find, Drag, etc.
 *   <li><b>Composite Actions</b>: Multi-step operations built from basic actions
 *   <li><b>Custom Actions</b>: Application-specific operations
 *   <li><b>Mock Actions</b>: Test implementations for development and testing
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In the model-based approach, ActionInterface enables the framework to treat all GUI operations
 * uniformly, regardless of their complexity. This abstraction is crucial for building maintainable
 * automation scripts where actions can be easily substituted, extended, or composed without
 * changing the calling code.

     *

     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code FIND} - Searches for visual patterns on screen
     *   <li>{@code CLICK} - Performs mouse click operations
     *   <li>{@code DEFINE} - Captures a screen region with specific coordinates
     *   <li>{@code TYPE} - Sends keyboard input to the active window
     *   <li>{@code MOVE} - Moves the mouse cursor to a location
     *   <li>{@code VANISH} - Waits for elements to disappear from screen
     *   <li>{@code HIGHLIGHT} - Draws visual indicators on matches or regions
     *   <li>{@code SCROLL_MOUSE_WHEEL} - Performs mouse wheel scrolling
     *   <li>{@code MOUSE_DOWN} - Presses and holds mouse button
     *   <li>{@code MOUSE_UP} - Releases mouse button
     *   <li>{@code KEY_DOWN} - Presses and holds keyboard key
     *   <li>{@code KEY_UP} - Releases keyboard key
     *   <li>{@code CLASSIFY} - Performs color-based classification
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p><strong>Composite Actions:</strong>
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code CLICK_UNTIL} - Repeatedly clicks until a condition is met
     *   <li>{@code DRAG} - Performs click-and-drag operations

     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Read action configuration from the ActionOptions within matches
     *   <li>Process target objects from the ObjectCollections
     *   <li>Execute the GUI operation (click, type, find, etc.)

     *   <li>Handle errors gracefully, updating matches with failure information

     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Modifies the GUI state through mouse/keyboard operations
     *   <li>Updates the matches parameter with execution results
     *   <li>May capture screenshots or log execution details

     * provides input configuration via ActionOptions and accumulates output results. This design
     * enables action chaining and comprehensive result tracking.
     *
     * @param matches Contains ActionOptions for configuration and accumulates execution results.
     *     This object is modified during execution to record matches found, success/failure status,
     *     and timing information.
     * @param objectCollections Variable number of collections containing target objects
     *     (StateImages, Regions, Locations, Strings) that the action will operate on. Actions may
     *     use zero, one, or multiple collections.
