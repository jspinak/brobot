/**
 * Core interface for all actions in the Brobot model-based GUI automation framework.
 * 
 * <p>ActionInterface defines the contract that all action implementations must follow, 
 * establishing a uniform execution pattern across the entire Action Model (Î±). This 
 * interface is the foundation of Brobot's action architecture, enabling polymorphic 
 * dispatch of diverse GUI operations through a single, consistent API.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Key design principles:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Uniform Execution</b>: All actions, from simple clicks to complex workflows, 
 *       implement the same perform() method signature</li>
 *   <li><b>Result Accumulation</b>: Actions modify the provided Matches object to record 
 *       their results and maintain execution context</li>
 *   <li><b>Flexible Input</b>: Accepts variable ObjectCollections to support actions 
 *       requiring different numbers of targets</li>
 *   <li><b>Composability</b>: Enables actions to be combined into composite operations</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>The perform method contract:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Receives a Matches object containing ActionOptions and accumulating results</li>
 *   <li>Processes one or more ObjectCollections containing the action targets</li>
 *   <li>Updates the Matches object with results of the action</li>
 *   <li>May throw runtime exceptions for error conditions</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>Implementation categories:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Basic Actions</b>: Click, Type, Find, Drag, etc.</li>
 *   <li><b>Composite Actions</b>: Multi-step operations built from basic actions</li>
 *   <li><b>Custom Actions</b>: Application-specific operations</li>
 *   <li><b>Mock Actions</b>: Test implementations for development and testing</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>In the model-based approach, ActionInterface enables the framework to treat all 
 * GUI operations uniformly, regardless of their complexity. This abstraction is crucial 
 * for building maintainable automation scripts where actions can be easily substituted, 
 * extended, or composed without changing the calling code.</p>

    /**
     * Executes the action with the provided configuration and target objects.
     * <p>
     * This method is the core execution point for all GUI automation actions in Brobot.
     * Implementations should follow these guidelines:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Read action configuration from the ActionOptions within matches</li>
     * <li>Process target objects from the ObjectCollections</li>
     * <li>Execute the GUI operation (click, type, find, etc.)</li>
     * <li>Update the matches object with results (found elements, success status)</li>
     * <li>Handle errors gracefully, updating matches with failure information</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <strong>Side effects:</strong>
     * <ul>
     * <li>Modifies the GUI state through mouse/keyboard operations</li>
     * <li>Updates the matches parameter with execution results</li>
     * <li>May capture screenshots or log execution details</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <strong>Implementation note:</strong> The matches parameter serves dual purposes -
     * it provides input configuration via ActionOptions and accumulates output results.
     * This design enables action chaining and comprehensive result tracking.
     *
     * @param matches Contains ActionOptions for configuration and accumulates execution results.
     *                This object is modified during execution to record matches found,
     *                success/failure status, and timing information.
     * @param objectCollections Variable number of collections containing target objects
     *                         (StateImages, Regions, Locations, Strings) that the action
     *                         will operate on. Actions may use zero, one, or multiple collections.
