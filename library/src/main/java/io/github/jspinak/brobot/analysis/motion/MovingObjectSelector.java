/**
 * Identifies moving objects by analyzing motion patterns across three consecutive scenes.
 * This class implements an algorithm that distinguishes true moving objects from
 * background changes by tracking consistent motion trajectories.
 * 
 * <p>The algorithm works by:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Finding overlapping regions between scene transitions</li>
 * <li>Identifying opposite-direction movements that indicate object motion</li>
 * <li>Verifying consistent distances to confirm the same object is moving</li>
 * </ul></p>
 * 
 * <p>A moving object is identified when:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A match region overlaps between two scene transitions</li>
 * <li>There's a match in the opposite direction (>150Â° difference)</li>
 * <li>The distances are consistent, indicating the same object</li>
 * </ol></p>
 * 
 * <p>This approach effectively filters out camera movements and background
 * changes, focusing on objects that move independently within the scene.</p>
