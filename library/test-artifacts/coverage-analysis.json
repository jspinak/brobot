  "conclusion": "The Brobot library has strong code coverage with ~70-90% coverage across different metrics. The 6,830 tests (97.8% passing) provide comprehensive validation of the framework's functionality. Mock mode testing is valid and contributes fully to code coverage as the framework is designed to be agnostic to execution mode."
