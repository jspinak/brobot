/* Allow for removing images from the state, adding images from file to the state with a dialog box,
selecting an image as a transition and selecting the state transitioned to, adding inputs to be used
during testing to a text box, which other states could be hidden by this state, adding states to 
other states, removing states.

how do you store the text box inputs in java? StateImage objects can include fields such as textInputs
to be used during testing. testInputs would be selected randomly. for targeted text inputs, you 
could write logic in the client app. textInputs and numberInputs. 

how to deal with adding screenshots to the model? there may be states that have been merged or 
deleted or images that have been removed from the model that will appear again in the screenshots.
this is a function that can come later since it's not necessary for a MVP.
