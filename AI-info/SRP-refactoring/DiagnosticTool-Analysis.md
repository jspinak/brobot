# DiagnosticTool Analysis

## Current Structure (441 lines)

### Class Overview
The DiagnosticTool is a monolithic class that handles multiple diagnostic responsibilities including system information collection, memory analysis, thread monitoring, performance metrics, health checks, and report generation.

### Current Responsibilities

1. **System Information Collection**
   - OS and JVM information
   - Environment variables
   - System properties
   - CPU usage

2. **Memory Diagnostics**
   - Heap and non-heap memory usage
   - Memory pool analysis
   - Memory health checks

3. **Thread Diagnostics**
   - Thread counts and states
   - Deadlock detection
   - Thread health assessment

4. **Performance Metrics**
   - GC statistics
   - Performance profiler integration
   - CPU usage monitoring

5. **Health Checks**
   - Memory health
   - Thread health
   - GC health
   - Error rate health
   - Disk space health

6. **Report Generation**
   - Report formatting
   - Export to file
   - Uptime and byte formatting

### Key Components

1. **MXBean Dependencies**
   - RuntimeMXBean
   - OperatingSystemMXBean
   - MemoryMXBean
   - ThreadMXBean
   - GarbageCollectorMXBeans

2. **External Dependencies**
   - PerformanceProfiler
   - ErrorHandler
   - ThreadManagementOptimizer

3. **Data Classes (in separate file)**
   - DiagnosticReport
   - SystemInfo
   - MemoryInfo
   - ThreadInfo
   - PerformanceMetrics
   - HealthCheckResult

### Problems with Current Design

1. **Violation of SRP**: Single class handles 6+ distinct responsibilities
2. **High Complexity**: Too many different concerns in one place
3. **Testing Difficulty**: Hard to test individual diagnostic aspects
4. **Poor Modularity**: Cannot use individual diagnostics separately
5. **Mixed Abstraction Levels**: Low-level MXBean calls mixed with high-level reporting

## Proposed Refactoring

### Service Breakdown

1. **SystemInfoCollectorService** (~120 lines)
   - Responsibility: Collect system and JVM information
   - Key methods: collectSystemInfo(), collectEnvironmentVariables(), collectSystemProperties()
   - Manages: OS info, JVM info, runtime info

2. **MemoryDiagnosticService** (~150 lines)
   - Responsibility: Analyze memory usage and health
   - Key methods: collectMemoryInfo(), analyzeMemoryPools(), checkMemoryHealth()
   - Manages: Memory MXBeans, memory calculations

3. **ThreadDiagnosticService** (~140 lines)
   - Responsibility: Monitor thread state and health
   - Key methods: collectThreadInfo(), detectDeadlocks(), checkThreadHealth()
   - Manages: ThreadMXBean, thread analysis

4. **PerformanceDiagnosticService** (~130 lines)
   - Responsibility: Collect performance metrics
   - Key methods: collectPerformanceMetrics(), analyzeGCMetrics(), checkGCHealth()
   - Manages: GC beans, CPU metrics

5. **HealthCheckService** (~120 lines)
   - Responsibility: Run health checks across all components
   - Key methods: runHealthChecks(), checkDiskSpace(), aggregateHealthStatus()
   - Manages: Health check orchestration

6. **DiagnosticReportService** (~100 lines)
   - Responsibility: Format and export diagnostic reports
   - Key methods: formatReport(), exportDiagnostics(), formatters
   - Manages: Report generation logic

7. **DiagnosticTool** (Orchestrator) (~80 lines)
   - Responsibility: Coordinate diagnostic services
   - Key methods: runDiagnostics(), exportDiagnostics()
   - Manages: Service coordination

### Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service focuses on one diagnostic aspect
2. **Testability**: Individual services can be tested in isolation
3. **Reusability**: Services can be used independently
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new diagnostic services
5. **Maintainability**: Changes isolated to specific services

### Migration Strategy

1. Extract services one by one
2. Keep data classes in separate file
3. Maintain public API compatibility
4. Add comprehensive tests for each service
5. Ensure thread-safe implementations where needed
