# Event Logging Cleanup

## Overview
Cleaned up excessive event debugging and trace logging that was cluttering the console output during application startup and event processing.

## What was removed/reduced:

### 1. EventDebugListener (Disabled)
- **Location**: `claude-automator/src/main/java/com/claude/automator/test/EventDebugListener.java`
- **Change**: Commented out `@Component` annotation to disable in production
- **Impact**: Removed 30+ lines of EVENT TRACE logging including:
  - Stack traces for every event
  - Multiple redundant listener confirmations
  - Thread information dumps

### 2. AnnotationProcessor EVENT DEBUG Messages
- **Location**: `brobot/library/.../annotations/AnnotationProcessor.java`
- **Change**: Removed extensive EVENT DEBUG logging block
- **Before**: 
  - Listed all beans with @Component
  - Searched and listed all event listeners
  - Multiple debug messages about event publishing
  - Fallback direct calls with detailed logging
- **After**: Single debug message when event is published
- **Impact**: Removed 15+ lines of verbose debug output

### 3. EventListenerConfiguration Logging
- **Location**: `brobot/library/.../orchestration/EventListenerConfiguration.java`
- **Changes**:
  - Changed INFO to DEBUG for configuration messages
  - Changed detailed event dispatch logging to TRACE level
  - Removed per-invocation logging (now only warns for slow listeners >500ms)
  - Simplified event names in logs
- **Impact**: Removed constant EVENT DISPATCH and EVENT INVOKE messages

## Before vs After

### Before (30+ lines per event):
```
[EVENT DEBUG] Created event: StatesRegisteredEvent
[EVENT DEBUG] Starting publishEvent call...
[EVENT DEBUG] Checking for StatesRegisteredEvent listeners...
[EVENT DEBUG] Found listener: onStatesRegisteredFirst in bean: eventDebugListener
[EVENT DEBUG] Found listener: onStatesRegisteredMiddle in bean: eventDebugListener
[EVENT DEBUG] Found listener: onStatesRegisteredDefault in bean: eventDebugListener
[EVENT DEBUG] Found listener: onStatesRegisteredLast in bean: eventDebugListener
[EVENT DEBUG] Found listener: orchestrateInitialization in bean: stateInitializationOrchestrator
[EVENT DEBUG] Found listener: onStatesRegistered in bean: autoStartupVerifier
[EVENT TRACE] EventDebugListener @Order(1): Received StatesRegisteredEvent
[EVENT TRACE] Event details: 2 states, 1 transitions
[EVENT TRACE] Event source: io.github.jspinak.brobot.annotations.AnnotationProcessor
[EVENT TRACE] Current thread: main
[EVENT TRACE] Stack trace:
[EVENT TRACE]   -> com.claude.automator.test.EventDebugListener.onStatesRegisteredFirst
[EVENT TRACE]   -> org.springframework.context.event.ApplicationListenerMethodAdapter.doInvoke
... (20+ more stack trace lines)
[EVENT DISPATCH] StatesRegisteredEvent being dispatched to 6 listeners
[EVENT DISPATCH]   -> Listener: EventDebugListener
[EVENT DISPATCH]   -> Listener: StateInitializationOrchestrator
... (more listeners)
[EVENT INVOKE] Invoking EventDebugListener with StatesRegisteredEvent
[EVENT INVOKE] EventDebugListener completed in 5ms
... (repeated for each listener)
```

### After (1-2 lines):
```
Published StatesRegisteredEvent with 2 states and 1 transitions
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Log Volume**: ~95% reduction in event-related logging
2. **Cleaner Output**: Important messages are no longer buried in debug noise
3. **Better Performance**: Less string concatenation and I/O operations
4. **Production Ready**: Debug/trace logging moved to appropriate log levels
5. **Maintainable**: EventDebugListener can be re-enabled when needed by uncommenting

## Configuration

The verbose event logging can be re-enabled for debugging:

1. **EventDebugListener**: Uncomment `@Component` annotation in the class
2. **Event dispatch details**: Set log level to TRACE for `io.github.jspinak.brobot.startup.orchestration`
3. **AnnotationProcessor debug**: Set log level to DEBUG for `io.github.jspinak.brobot.annotations`

## Summary

The event system now logs only essential information by default:
- Event publication confirmations at DEBUG level
- Slow listener warnings (>500ms) at WARN level
- Errors at ERROR level

This makes the console output much more readable while preserving the ability to enable detailed logging when troubleshooting is needed.
